    What is the U.S. position on Iran?
  </div>

  <div class="position-on-iran-content">
    <p class="position-on-iran-content-bold">
      The United States respects and supports the struggle of the people of Iran for human rights,
      democracy, and freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      The biggest victims of the Iranian regime are the Iranian people themselves. Their resources
      are squandered, opportunities usurped by regime elites, and their freedom and basic human
      rights suppressed.
    </p>

    <p class="position-on-iran-content-bold">
      In addition, the Islamic Regime in Iran is the largest worldwide sponsor of terror.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to the regimeâ€™s destabilizing and malign behavior both to its own people and to the region
      and the world, the United States has instituted a maximum pressure campaign to deprive the
      regime in Iran of the resources it needs to conduct terror inside and outside its borders.
