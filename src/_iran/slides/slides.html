          Iran’s regime routinely punishes activists and religious and ethnic minorities for
          peaceful activities, preventing the free exercise of belief and expression.

          Since the 1979 revolution, Iran’s regime has conducted terrorist attacks and
          assassinations in more than 20 countries.

          Iran’s development and proliferation of ballistic missiles poses a critical threat to
          regional security and a significant challenge to global nonproliferation efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2010, the UN Security Council severely restricted Iran’s ballistic missiles program to
          limit the regime’s ability to deliver a nuclear warhead in the future.

          The regime’s environmental mismanagement hurts the Iranian people in many ways, most
          notably by limiting access to water in approximately 96 percent of the country.

          According to a 2017 United Nations report, water shortages in Iran are so acute that
          making a living in agricultural is no longer sustainable.
