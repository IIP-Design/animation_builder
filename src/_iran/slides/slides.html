          The regime frequently targets Iranian activists and religious and ethnic minorities for
          peaceful civic activities and the exercise of freedom of expression and belief.

          Currently, there are more than 800 prisoners of conscience detained in Iran.

          Since the Iranian regime came to power in 1979, Iran has conducted terrorist plots,
          assassinations, and attacks in more than 20 countries worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          In July 2018, an Iranian agent was caught in a foiled terror plot on Iranian dissidents in
          Paris.

          Iran’s development and proliferation of ballistic missiles poses a critical threat to
          regional security and remains a significant challenge to global nonproliferation efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2010, the UN Security Council placed tough limitations on Iran's ballistic missiles
          program, recognizing that such missiles would likely be Iran's preferred method of
          delivering a warhead in the future.

          The Iranian Navy has overstepped its power in the region's waterways consistently--holding
          international naval crews captive, firing shots at cargo ships, and causing near

          The Iranian people feel the pain of the regime’s environmental mismanagement in many ways,
          but limited access to water is among the most pronounced and affects approximately 96
          percent of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a 2017 report by the United Nations, water shortages in Iran are so acute
          that agricultural livelihoods are no longer sustainable.

          The Islamic Republic is a leading threat actor in cyberspace. It has developed cyber
          capabilities with the intent to surveil and sabotage its adversaries and threaten
          international stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past decade, public reporting indicates that the Iranian regime has conducted
          cyber operations targeting governments and commercial and civil society entities in the
          U.S., Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, among others.
