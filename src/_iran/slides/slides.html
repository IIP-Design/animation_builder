          Iran’s development and proliferation of ballistic missiles poses a critical threat to
          regional security and a significant challenge to global nonproliferation efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2010, the UN Security Council severely restricted Iran's ballistic missiles program to
          limit the regime’s ability to deliver a nuclear warhead in the future.

          The regime’s environmental mismanagement hurts the Iranian people in many ways, most
          notably by limiting access to water in approximately 96 percent of the country.
