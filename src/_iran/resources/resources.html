            <p>
              Iranian women are fighting back against the Islamic regime’s oppressive policies,
              including through the White Wednesday movement, in which women wear white to protest a
              requirement they wear headscarves in public.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iranian activist Masih Alinejad supports White Wednesdays from outside her native
              country, running the website My Stealthy Freedom that shows images of women not
              wearing hijab.
            </p>
            <p>
              An Iranian judge in July sentenced three women to a combined 55 years in prison for
              peacefully protesting mandatory hijab. U.S. officials have denounced the punishment as
              a “grave violation” of basic human rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Women also have rallied around Sahar Khodayari’s protest against the Iranian regime’s
              ban on women attending football matches. Khodayari, 29 and nicknamed “the Blue Girl”
              for the color of her favorite football team, died after setting herself on fire when
              she learned she faced prison for trying to sneak into a game.

              Iran’s authoritarian regime governs the theocratic republic with laws and regulations
              based on Ja’fari Shia Islam.
            </p>
            <p>
              The regime harasses and arrests religious minorities, including Baha’is, Christians,
              Sunni Muslims, Zoroastrians and Jews, according to the State Department’s 2018 Report
              on Religious Freedom for Iran. The regime in December 2018 arrested 142 Christians,
              after arresting at least 40 members of the Baha’i faith October and November of that
              year.

              Workers in Iran and lawyers who represent them risk prison and lashings for protesting
              unpaid wages or simply doing their jobs. Reporters Without Borders in 2019 ranked Iran
              170 out of 180 in its World Press Freedom Index, citing increasing arrests of Iranian
              journalists covering anti-government protests or posting comments critical of the
              government on social media.
            </p>
            <p>
              An Iranian judge in August 2019 sentenced 16 sugar factory workers to 30 lashes and
              eight months in prison for protesting unpaid wages. The punishment flies in the face
              of the Iran’s constitution, which permits public gatherings and marches.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea is the brainchild of Masih Alinejad, founder of My Stealthy Freedom, an
              online movement opposed to the mandatory dress code. Before the 1979 Islamic
              revolution many Iranian women wore Western-style outfits, including miniskirts and
              short-sleeved tops, but this all changed when the late Ayatollah Khomeini came to
              power.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iran’s Revolutionary Court recently sentenced defense lawyer Amirsalar Davoudi to 30
              years in prison and 111 lashes for highlighting human rights abuses in Iran in his
              social media posts.
