        The United States supports the Iranian people’s struggle for human rights, democracy, and
        freedom.

      <p class="position-text-normal">
        The regime’s greatest victims are the Iranian people. Regime elites squander the people’s
        resources and opportunities, while suppressing freedom and basic human rights.

        Iran’s Islamic regime also is the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.
      </p>
      <p class="position-text-normal">
        To counter the regime’s destabilizing and malign behavior both at home and abroad, the
        United States is pursuing a maximum pressure campaign to deprive the regime of the resources
        it needs to brutalize its own people and fuel terrorism abroad.
