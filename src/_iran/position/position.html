    What is the U.S. position on Iran?
  </h3>

  <div class="position-text">
    <strong>
      The United States supports the Iranian people’s struggle for human rights, democracy, and
      freedom.
    </strong>
    <p>
      The regime’s greatest victims are the Iranian people. Regime elites squander the people’s
      resources and opportunities, while suppressing freedom and basic human rights.
    </p>
    <strong>
      Iran’s Islamic regime also is the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.
    </strong>
    <p>
      To counter the regime’s destabilizing and malign behavior both at home and abroad, the United
      States is pursuing a maximum pressure campaign to deprive the regime of the resources it needs
      to brutalize its own people and fuel terrorism abroad.
