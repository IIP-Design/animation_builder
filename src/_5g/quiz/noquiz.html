    Mitigation
  </h3>

    There is no safe space for untrustworthy vendors in the 5G network.
  </h4>

  <p class="tf-carousel-description">
    The assessment of the United States’ technical experts is that the risks of allowing Chinese
    telecommunications equipment anywhere in 5G networks cannot be mitigated. Given how 5G networks
    will be built, there will be no safe parts of a 5G network for untrusted equipment. Allowing
    Chinese telecommunications equipment into any part of a 5G network therefore creates
    unacceptable risks to national security, critical infrastructure, privacy, and human rights.
