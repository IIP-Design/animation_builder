    Huawei
  </h2>

  <h3 class="tf-subtitle">
    Myth vs. Fact
  </h3>

  <p class="tf-description">
    The telecom company Huawei wants to install its 5G equipment in networks worldwide. Since many
    are uneasy about the company, Huawei is aggressively spreading misleading and false information
    about its technical capabilities, ownership, and legal obligations to the People’s Republic of
    China (PRC) and Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Huawei cannot be trusted to tell the truth or
    protect the interests of others, and it should not be trusted with the vital security of 5G
    networks.
