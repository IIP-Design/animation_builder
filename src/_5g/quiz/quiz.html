      The telecom company Huawei wants to install its 5G equipment in networks worldwide. Since many
      are uneasy about the company, Huawei is aggressively spreading misleading and false
      information about its technical capabilities, ownership, and legal obligations to the People’s
      Republic of China (PRC) and Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Huawei cannot be trusted to tell
      the truth or protect the interests of others, and it should not be trusted with the vital
      security of 5G networks.
