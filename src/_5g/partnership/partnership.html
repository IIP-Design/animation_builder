      We welcome collaboration with partners and allies to ensure our shared security in a 5G
      future. Were a country to elect to allow an untrusted company to build out its 5G network, the
      United States would have to reassess how it interconnects and shares information with that
      country.

        “It is a very different thing to engage in transactions that have a national security
        component to them. When a nation shows up and offers you goods that are well below market,
        one ought to ask what else is at play, why it was that that entity showed up with a deal
        that is literally too good to be true.”
