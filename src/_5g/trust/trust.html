          You need to be able to trust that 5G equipment and software companies will not threaten
          your national security, privacy, intellectual property, or human rights. Trust cannot
          exist where telecom vendors are subject to an authoritarian government, like the People’s
          Republic of China that lacks an independent judiciary or rule of law that would prevent
          this misuse of data. Further, ownership of Huawei is not transparent, and has a history of
          unethical and illegal behavior, including IP theft.
