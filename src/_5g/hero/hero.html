        Fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology will form the backbone of future economies and
        public services. Newly networked societies will be critically reliant on innovative new
        applications. Countries must take action now to safeguard their emerging 5G networks,
        because the stakes could not be higher.

        “The Chinese Communist Party has access to information that runs across Chinese networks.
        It’s in their basic laws. I don’t think it’s in the best interest of any country to take the
        data from their private citizens and place it in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.”
      </p>
      <p>– Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo</p>
